# Markdown Test
This document is a test to demonstrate that my knowledge of using markdown, developed while creating personal projects with TheHomebrewery,
can be effectively carried over to my role at the Wellcome Trust.

Headings are made by preceding the text at the start of a line using a hash symbol, for example 

`# Title` would produce the following:

# Title 

An increased number of hash symbols creates a smaller heading.

### Tables

##### Sample Table
|1 |2 |3 |
|:----|:-----:|-----:|
|Right aligned | Centred | Left |
| A | B | C |



> ### Sample Text Box
> Where in my own projects a text box like this would be used for rules inserts, like quick references to related rulings, in this
> context the text box serves similar funtion in bringing an aside that can be treated separate to the main body of the text.
> With the style of this site, it would also be apt for bringing attention to key quotes from the body of text.

For example:

> ### *"(These blockquotes) would also be apt for bringing attention to key quotes from the body of text."*

**Bold**, *italics*, and ***the two combined*** are done through the use of asterisks. 
Asterisks either side of the text (with no space between the asterisk and the first and last characters, for example typing
`*Italic*` results in the word appearing as *Italic*) 
produce the following results, depending on the number used.

| Number of asterisks either side of text | Effect on Text |
|---|---:|
| One | *Italic* |
| Two | **Bold** |
| Three | ***Bold and Italic*** |
| Four or more | ****No further effect, reverts to bold**** |
