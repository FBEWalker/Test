# 3.2 Personal Data Flowchart
We first assess the suitability of material for onsite access for research purposes. Suitability for online access is assessed separately in Section 6.

**Material with permissions** from the individual whose personal or special category data  features in the material

Sometimes the individual whose personal or special category data features in material gives us permission to make that material available for research or other activities. Where we have such explicit consent, material can be made open to view onsite (subject to a review of other forms of sensitivity, including personal data relating to other individuals). We only accept permission for access to all library members and do not accept limited permission, such as access only to certain professions. We do not, as a rule, attempt to trace and contact people but we are always keen to hear from individuals whose personal data we hold. 

**Material without permissions** from the individual whose personal or special category data features in the material

We use the workflow below (fig. 2) to guide decision making when determining the appropriate access status for material.
Guidelines on how to undertake sensitivity review and document the results are provided in Section X. Guidelines on appropriate closure and restricted periods are provided in Section X. Guidelines on applying the Open With Advisory status are provided in Section X.

**1.	Identifiable individuals**

Information that distinguishes an individual from other members of a group. As well as written information, a person can be identified from their body, most commonly their face, but possibly also other distinguishing body features such as tattoos or birthmarks. Voices are also considered identifying information.

**2.	Data has been made public as a result of steps deliberately taken by the individual**

In the absence of documented consent from the individual, we use our judgement to decide whether they have deliberately participated in making their data public, the circumstances around this and thus whether the information can be made available by us. We consider the extent to which the information has previously been made public and whether circumstances have since changed, which might suggest that disclosure could have a detrimental effect on the individual. 

**3.	Material was created for and distributed to a wide, general public audience/specific, limited public audience**

Was the material intended for or distributed to a wide general audience (e.g. a public information film designed to encourage public uptake of TB testing), or was it created for a specific, limited audience (e.g. a recording of an operation made as a surgical training aid)?

**4.	Content that is distressing or offensive to the viewer**

Written description, imagery or audio that the viewer may find distressing, uncomfortable or harmful. Content can include, but is not limited to:
* Gore and bodily fluids
*	Surgery
*	Nudity
*	Sexually explicit content
*	Body mutilation
*	Corpses	
* People in severe pain or distress
*	Animal experimentation and/or cruelty
*	Offensive and/or derogatory language
*	Graphic drug use 
*	Flashing images

**5.	Vulnerable people and people in a vulnerable position**
This can include but is not limited to:
*	Being associated with a something that carries stigma and/or is controversial (i.e. mental health problems, STIs, abortion, learning difficulties)
*	Nudity 
*	Being in severe pain or distress
*	Being in restraints or being restrained
*	Engaging in animal experimentation

**6.	Manual filing system**

A set of records that are held in a sufficiently structured way as to allow ready access to specific information about individuals.

**7.	Special category personal data**

These are types of personal information that are considered more sensitive under data protection law and which therefore require more protection. This can include information about an individual’s: health; sex life; sexual orientation; race; ethnic origin; genetics; biometrics (where used for ID purposes); political view; and trade union membership. All such information should be considered more carefully when reviewing material.
 
**8.	There is additional information in the surrounding files to increase sensitivity**

Information can be extracted from surrounding records or catalogue metadata to increase the sensitivity of the file. For instance, a photograph of workshop participants with a catalogue description identifying the location as a psychiatric hospital.

**9.	Close, restrict or redact on a case by case basis (see page X for a definition of these statuses)**

A decision will be based on the exact nature of the sensitive data, its relevance to the rest of the file and the level of potential distress that could be caused.
